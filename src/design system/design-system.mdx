# Design System
The design system serves as a single source of truth based on Gymshark, establishing a unified and cohesive visual language, interaction patterns, and brand identity across all digital touchpoints. It is a comprehensive framework that guides design and development decisions to ensure consistency and scalability. For example, Gymshark’s design system includes detailed brand guidelines (logo usage, color palette, typography, imagery) to maintain the brand’s unique personality. By streamlining processes and reusing components, the system aims to optimize efficiency, reduce development time, and improve overall quality. In practice, the core node governs all other sections (audience insights, principles, components, patterns, content, accessibility) and ensures they align with Gymshark’s high-performance, clarity-focused brand ethos.

# Visual Primitives

## Colours
![Colors](img/primitive-colors.png)

### Primary (black)
      <p>Main text, primary buttons, key graphics. Primary gymshark logo is black.</p>
### Secondary (white)
      <p>Page background, secondary backgrounds, reverse text (on black). White provides the clean, minimalist base.</p>
### Accent (green)
      <p>Highlight CTAs (e.g. "Shop Now"), links, icons or overlays. This bright energetic green (or a similar vibrancy) emphasizes action and performance.</p>
### Neutral (gray)
      <p>Secondary text, placeholders, icon color. Provides hierarchy below black.</p>
### Error (red)
      <p>Error messages or destructive actions.</p>

> Notes: Black-on-white yields excellent readability and a “heavyweight” look as Gymshark’s brand suggests. Accent colors like neon green inject vibrancy without overwhelming the minimalist base. All color combinations will meet WCAG contrast (see Accessibility).







## Typography

## Spacing & Sizing

This modular scale ensures rhythm and alignment (for example, cards might have 16px padding, 24px margin between elements).

## Imagery

Visuals should capture Gymshark’s dynamic, empowering spirit. Use high-resolution photos of diverse athletes in authentic workout settings. Images should feature action and effort (lifting, running, training) to convey energy and progress. Gymshark imagery often emphasizes real people pushing their limits.

### Key Guidelines

- Show a range of body types, genders, and ethnicities

- Include Gymshark gear prominently

- Cohesive photo treatment ( brightness/contrast/intensity)

- Clean, natural lighting

#### Graphic Elements
- Very minimal fancy stuff, we want to redirect all the attention to the athlete and the action

> The goal is to motivate: each image should make the user feel inspired to train or to engage with the community. Copy and overlays on images should use the brand voice (motivational, inclusive) and ensure text contrast meets accessibility.

# Content Guidelines

## Voice & Tone

Gymshark’s voice is empowering, motivational, and community-focused. Writing is in the second person (“you”) and present tense to speak directly to the user. Tone is bold but friendly, encouraging rather than intimidating. 

For example, marketing copy might say, “Engineered for your grind. Breathes with every rep” instead of dry product specs. We mirror the brand values: messages are inclusive (“you belong here” vs. excluding language) and motivational (“Smash your limits” rather than polite suggestions). Overall, the voice should feel like a supportive coach or workout partner who challenges and uplifts the user.

## Vocabulary

### Do's
- Limitless
- Unstoppable
- Strength
- Power
- Grind
- Champion
- Together
- Move
- Challenge
- Achieve
- Game-changing
- Fuel
- Performance

### Don'ts
- Can't
- Should
- Only
- Average
- Weak
- Impossible

> Gymshark copy avoids phrasing like “Only for serious lifters”. Focus on clear benefit language rather than technical jargon.

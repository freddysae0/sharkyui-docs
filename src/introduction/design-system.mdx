# Design System

The design system serves as a single source of truth based on Gymshark, establishing a unified and cohesive visual language, interaction patterns, and brand identity across all digital touchpoints. It is a comprehensive framework that guides design and development decisions to ensure consistency and scalability. For example, Gymshark’s design system includes detailed brand guidelines (logo usage, color palette, typography, imagery) to maintain the brand’s unique personality. By streamlining processes and reusing components, the system aims to optimize efficiency, reduce development time, and improve overall quality. In practice, the core node governs all other sections (audience insights, principles, components, patterns, content, accessibility) and ensures they align with Gymshark’s high-performance, clarity-focused brand ethos.
# Audience

The audience section defines who we design for, guiding tone, content, and feature priorities. Gymshark’s primary and secondary audiences include:

# Visual Primitives

## Colors

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Role</th>
      <th>Color (Hex)</th>
      <th>Usage</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Primary</td>
      <td>#000000 (Black)</td>
      <td>Main text, primary buttons, key graphics. Primary gymshark logo is black.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Secondary</td>
      <td>#FFFFFF (White)</td>
      <td>Page background, secondary backgrounds, reverse text (on black). White provides the clean, minimalist base.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Background</td>
      <td>#F5F5F5 (Light Gray)</td>
      <td>Page sections or cards to separate content subtly. Soft neutral to maintain contrast.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accent (Action)</td>
      <td>#00FF7F (Neon Green)</td>
      <td>Highlight CTAs (e.g. "Shop Now"), links, icons or overlays. This bright energetic green (or a similar vibrancy) emphasizes action and performance.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Neutral</td>
      <td>#4A4A4A (Dark Gray)</td>
      <td>Secondary text, placeholders, icon color. Provides hierarchy below black.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Error/Danger</td>
      <td>#E63946 (Red)</td>
      <td>Error messages or destructive actions (low usage but needed).</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

> Notes: Black-on-white yields excellent readability and a “heavyweight” look as Gymshark’s brand suggests. Accent colors like neon green inject vibrancy without overwhelming the minimalist base. All color combinations will meet WCAG contrast (see Accessibility).







## Typography

The font scheme reinforces Gymshark’s bold, geometric style. Gymshark’s logotype uses a condensed all-caps sans serif (similar to Bebas Neue). We use this or a comparable geometric display font for headings to echo the logo’s sharp lines. Body text and UI copy use a clean sans-serif (e.g. Roboto or Open Sans), which is highly legible on screens.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Element</th>
      <th>Font Family</th>
      <th>Weight</th>
      <th>Usage</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Headings (H1-H4)</td>
      <td>Bebas Neue (or similar)</td>
      <td>Bold (700) or Heavy</td>
      <td>Section titles, page banners, emphasis text (all-caps style for strong impact).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Body Copy</td>
      <td>Roboto / Open Sans</td>
      <td>Regular (400), Medium (500)</td>
      <td>Paragraphs, descriptions, product copy. Ample line-height (~1.5) for readability.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Buttons/CTAs</td>
      <td>Bebas Neue (Bold 700)</td>
      <td>Bold</td>
      <td>Button labels to match heading style (all-caps or title-case).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Navigation Links</td>
      <td>Roboto / Open Sans</td>
      <td>Medium (500)</td>
      <td>Menu items, smaller text in header/footer.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Accents/Labels</td>
      <td>Roboto / Open Sans</td>
      <td>Regular/Bold</td>
      <td>Captions, badges, form labels.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Headers are sized to create a clear hierarchy (e.g. H1 ~48px, H2 ~36px, down to H5 ~18px) with line-heights ~1.3x. Body text is ~16px base with comfortable line-height ~1.5, scaling up for smaller devices if needed. For mobile, text can scale slightly (responsive text) but keep contrast and spacing consistent.

## Spacing & Sizing

We employ an 8px base grid for all spacing (margins, padding, gaps). Common spacing scale:
- 4px (small gutters)
- 8px (base unit)
- 16px (double)
- 24px
- 32px
- 48px

This modular scale ensures rhythm and alignment (for example, cards might have 16px padding, 24px margin between elements).

### Grid Layout

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Breakpoint</th>
      <th>Width Range</th>
      <th>Columns</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Mobile</td>
      <td>≤600px</td>
      <td>1 column</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tablet</td>
      <td>600–1024px</td>
      <td>2–4 columns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Desktop</td>
      <td>≥1024px</td>
      <td>4–6+ columns</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Breakpoints

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Breakpoint</th>
      <th>Width Range</th>
      <th>Grid</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Mobile</td>
      <td>0 – 599px</td>
      <td>1 column</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tablet</td>
      <td>600 – 1023px</td>
      <td>2–3 columns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Desktop</td>
      <td>1024 – 1439px</td>
      <td>4 columns</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Wide Desktop</td>
      <td>≥1440px</td>
      <td>6 columns</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

Consistent gutter margins (e.g., 16px on mobile, 24px on desktop) are used. Component sizes (buttons, cards) adjust to fit these grids. For example, a product card might be full-width on mobile but one-third width (with margin) on desktop. Heights of elements are typically “auto” except where explicit (e.g. hero banner height).

## Imagery

Visuals should capture Gymshark’s dynamic, empowering spirit. Use high-resolution photos of diverse athletes in authentic workout settings. Images should feature action and effort (lifting, running, training) to convey energy and progress. Gymshark imagery often emphasizes real people pushing their limits.

### Key Guidelines

#### Authentic & Inclusive
- Show a range of body types, genders, and ethnicities
- Reflect Gymshark’s inclusive ethos
- Avoid overly-staged or retouched shots
- Real sweat and motion preferred

#### Branding
- Include Gymshark gear prominently
- Ensure text overlay contrast
- Use semi-transparent dark overlays for readability

#### Consistency
- Cohesive photo treatment
- Consistent brightness/contrast
- Subtle filters
- Clean, natural lighting

#### Graphic Elements
- Minimal flourishes
- Simple colored shapes
- Subtle gradients in brand accent color
- Bold, line-based icons
- Custom shark-fin symbol for brand motif

The goal is to motivate: each image should make the user feel inspired to train or to engage with the community. Copy and overlays on images should use the brand voice (motivational, inclusive) and ensure text contrast meets accessibility.

# Content Guidelines

## Voice & Tone

Gymshark’s voice is empowering, motivational, and community-focused. Writing is in the second person (“you”) and present tense to speak directly to the user. Tone is bold but friendly, encouraging rather than intimidating. For example, marketing copy might say, “Engineered for your grind. Breathes with every rep” instead of dry product specs. We mirror the brand values: messages are inclusive (“you belong here” vs. excluding language) and motivational (“Smash your limits” rather than polite suggestions). Overall, the voice should feel like a supportive coach or workout partner who challenges and uplifts the user.

## Vocabulary

### Do's
- Limitless
- Unstoppable
- Strength
- Power
- Grind
- Champion
- Together
- Move
- Challenge
- Achieve
- Game-changing
- Fuel
- Performance

### Don'ts
- Can't
- Should
- Only
- Average
- Weak
- Impossible

> Gymshark copy avoids phrasing like “Only for serious lifters”. Focus on clear benefit language rather than technical jargon.

## Copywriting Rules

### Style
- Concise & Punchy
  - Sentences are typically short
  - Headlines or CTAs can be fragments
  - Body copy stays readable (≤20 words per sentence)

- Active Voice
  - Use active verbs (“crush”, “deliver”, “ignite”)
  - Create energy

- Structure
  - Motivational Hook + Personal Connection + Community Action
  - Example: “Break barriers. We’ve all faced that moment of doubt. Let’s crush it together.”
  - Start with a strong statement
  - Relate to the reader’s experience
  - Invite them to join or act

### Formatting
- CTA Format
  - Use imperative verbs
  - Keep short (1-3 words)
  - Consistent style (often all-caps)

- Grammar & Length
  - Correct grammar with informal tone
  - Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
  - Use bullet lists or numbered steps
  - End headings and bullet points with no period

> All content is double-checked for spelling and tone consistency, and always aligns with Gymshark’s identity of being bold and authentic.
